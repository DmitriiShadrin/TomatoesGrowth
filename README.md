The paper presents a technology for plant growth dynamics estimation and prediction in an artificial soilless system by using embedded artificial intelligence. The approach consists of a hardware setup for automated image acquisition, plant feeding system, low-power mobile graphical chip + RPI with embedded AI algorithms. The software part of the system relies on a recurrent neural network for time sequence prediction.

The [dataset and experiment description](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/90toa8u8we5vopr/AABlaXEsKmrsgW4yIdF2eC2ma?dl=0) of the time-sequenced top-down images of plant growth (5514 images) and growth conditions is publicly available This dataset is possible to use for training artificial neural networks for solving such problems as plant detection, segmentation, leaf area estimation, plant growth dynamics assessment.
